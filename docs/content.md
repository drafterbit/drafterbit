## Content

Content management is done by creating, editing or deleting markdown files in `content` directory.

Website url path is mapped to the markdown file or directory path. Table below illustrate
how we map url into file path.

|URL  |File Path|
| --- |-------- |
|/| content/index.md |
|/foo| content/foo.md or content/foo/index.md |
|/foo/bar| content/foo/bar.md or content/foo/bar/index.md
