## Edit This Page

Yes, this is not quite good content to show in your site. So here is quick tutor
step about how to edit this page.

Step 1. Edit this file according to your needs: `./content/index.md`

Step 2. That's it.


## Create New Page

To create new page, simply create markdown file in `./content` directory.
You can access it right away using the file name without the extension.
For example, if you create file `./content/hello-world.md`, then
you can access it in  `http://localhost:3000/hello-world`. Good Luck !

Feel free to read the [documentation](https://drafterbit.github.io/drafterbit)
for more detailed usage !.
